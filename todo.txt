Various things to do, not exhaustive that needs to go in the roadmap

- in dev mode : only compile the package of the application to speed up build
- translate Juzu scopes into other framework specific scopes : session scope to CDI scope, etc...
- in standalone mode : implement portlet Preferences with cookie
- improve startup error reporting, specially from plugins (cf asset plugin that validates classpath assets exist)
- option for copying an asset to the output
- send 404 when resource cannot be resolved with some warn in the log
- deploy URL (classloader) for classpath locations ?


- parse error in template parser
- more stack trace sanitization
- handle internal error correctly
- think about doing a "debug" portlet that would cooperate with juzu portlets
- for plugins : think about an @Depends to define dependencies for ordering (?)
- decouple plugin discovery from plugin bootstrap in order to know the declared classes / it's already more or less the case actually
- one issue is to bootstrap correctly juzu in a managed environment

Template suggestions:

- combine curly brace and angle bracket: <% if () {> <}>
- combine condition and angle bracket: <(a == 0)>
- property ${} combined with Elvis operator like : ?{} or $?{} to avoid "null" result
